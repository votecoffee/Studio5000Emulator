# Studio5000Emulator

An experimental offline Logix v35 emulator with a browser UI and local EtherNet/IP research endpoint.

Explore supported ladder and Structured Text logic, drive inputs, inspect scan
traces, and test explicit messaging against a custom execution model. The app
and executable use the name **LogixLab**.

**Status: experimental. Studio 5000 Go Online, upload/download and online edits
are not implemented or verified.** Supported instructions have bounded software
models; this project does not establish native controller equivalence.

Application development is maintained on `main`.

## Background

Studio5000Emulator is being built toward a custom Logix emulator, starting with
explicitly supported instructions and data types. It combines deterministic
local scans, a logic monitor, tag editing, coverage reports and protocol tracing.
Unsupported features are reported before execution where possible.

L5X execution uses Python's standard library. ACD import is optional and converts
a private copy through separately installed native tooling. The execution engine
runs independently after import and does not depend on FactoryTalk Logix Echo.

## Install

### Dependencies

- Windows and Python 3.13 for the tested source workflow.
- Optional ACD import: compatible Studio 5000/Logix Designer SDK tooling and an
  `l5xgit` converter. Configure it in **Import settings**, with
  `LOGIXLAB_CONVERTER`, or by placing `l5xgit` on `PATH`.
- Optional executable build: PyInstaller.
- Optional independent protocol probes: `pycomm3`.

```powershell
git clone --branch main https://github.com/votecoffee/Studio5000Emulator.git
cd Studio5000Emulator
py -3.13 -X utf8 source/launch.py
```

No additional Python packages are needed to run L5X projects or bundled demos.
See [development guidance](docs/development.md) for optional tooling, including
an offline CIP capture inspector for connection research.

## Usage

Choose a bundled demo or open a complete L5X export. Check **Coverage**, then use
**Step scan** or **Run**. Edit inputs in **Tag Watch** and inspect the logic trace.
The header shows the running app's full version and PLC endpoint IP. On Windows,
its tray icon offers
**Open app** and **Quit LogixLab**; hover over it to see the version and session
address. The icon may appear under the taskbar's hidden-icons arrow.

Use **End session** or **Quit LogixLab** to stop the app and its protocol endpoint.
Closing a browser tab leaves the app running; reopen it from the tray. `--no-tray`
disables the icon for headless runs.

Original project files are preserved. Settings and imported copies normally live
under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\LogixLab`; `--data-dir` selects another private directory.

For a separate PLC IP while Linx retains the host's port 44818, use the optional
[VMware host-only appliance](docs/vmware-appliance.md). After preparation,
`START-VM.cmd` starts it with a localhost browser tunnel and Windows tray controls.

### CLI

Start a demo with checkout-local session storage:

```powershell
py -3.13 -X utf8 source/launch.py --sample TextLab --data-dir .local/session
```

Generate an offline coverage report:

```powershell
py -3.13 -X utf8 source/launch.py --report source/samples/TextLab.L5X
```

Start the Network Lab's read-only EtherNet/IP endpoint:

```powershell
py -3.13 -X utf8 source/launch.py --sample NetworkLab --eip-port 44818 --eip-profile logix-v35-l85e --data-dir .local/network-session
```

The HTTP UI binds to `127.0.0.1`. The protocol endpoint defaults to that address;
**Bind IP** or `--eip-bind` selects another IPv4 address belonging to this PC.
See [Linx coexistence](docs/connectivity.md#linx-coexistence-and-addresses) if
another application owns port 44818. Protocol access starts disabled unless
requested. Tag writes require **Allow tag writes** or
`--eip-writes`. Use the **Connectivity** tab to start/stop the endpoint and export
its trace. See [connectivity documentation](docs/connectivity.md) for the supported
services, identity profiles and remaining Studio handshake work.

### Build an executable

```powershell
py -3.13 -m pip install pyinstaller
powershell -NoProfile -File source/build.ps1
.\dist\LogixLab.exe
```

The build places the executable under `dist/`. `START.cmd` launches that build.
Source-authored L5X demos are bundled; generated ACD files are kept local.

## Current Support

| Area | Available behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Projects | v35 L5X import; optional native ACD-to-L5X conversion on a copy |
| Execution | Supported RLL/ST forms, routine calls, AOIs and deterministic scans |
| Inspection | Coverage checks, tag watch, traces, snapshots and routine harnesses |
| EtherNet/IP | Unicast and Linux broadcast discovery, sessions, Class 3 messaging and atomic tag services |
| Atomic transfers | Reads/writes, fragmented transfers and integer OR/AND mask updates |
| Structured transfers | Aligned numeric UDTs, explicit packed Boolean flags and fragmented reads/writes |
| Catalog refresh | Controller class revision/inventory and source-bound comparison tokens |
| File Manager | Read-only class discovery; reports zero emulated storage devices |
| Network metadata | Read-only CIP port/node addresses, IPv4 configuration and actual adapter MAC |
| Device locator | Network-triggered blinking webpage banner with timed expiry and cancellation |
| Studio online | Go Online, project correlation, upload/download and online edits pending |

Coverage depends on the actual project and execution scope. Full task scheduling,
motion, physical I/O, CIP Safety, FBD/SFC and broad native runtime parity remain
outside the current model. Unknown data and unsupported forms are not silently
replaced with assumed behavior.

Read the [execution model](docs/execution-model.md) before interpreting scan
results, and the [protocol contract](docs/connectivity.md) before using clients.

## Development

The code, public L5X fixtures, tests and browser assets are under `source/`.
Shared technical documentation is under `docs/`. Build output goes to `dist/`.
See the [community project assessment](docs/community-projects.md) for reusable
components, licensing and conversion-validation results.

Run the behavioral suite from the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location source
py -3.13 -X utf8 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Store machine-specific notes, private PLC files, settings, captures and test
receipts in ignored `.local/` storage. Generated builds and local reports are
excluded from Git. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for checks and repository
conventions.

## Roadmap

- Expand supported instructions, data types and execution semantics.
- Add packed BOOLs, strings, predefined structures and more controller metadata.
- Establish a reproducible native Studio connection and project handshake.
- Demonstrate online monitoring before advertising Studio Go Online support.
- Add a host-only networking backend independent of VMware, evaluating free
  container and virtual-machine tooling. See the [milestones and backend comparison](docs/roadmap.md).
