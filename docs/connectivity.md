# EtherNet/IP connectivity

The endpoint is an experimental explicit-message target backed by the loaded
project's modeled memory. Studio Go Online, project correlation, upload/download,
online edits and native debugger services remain unimplemented or unverified.

## Start an endpoint

In the app, load a project and open **Connectivity**. Choose an identity profile
and port, then select **Start endpoint**. **Load network lab** opens a public
fixture with a 1,200-element DINT array, ControlWord, Command and read-only
Observed. Each modeled scan copies Command to Observed.

The default address is `127.0.0.1:44818`, with TCP and UDP listeners and a modeled
backplane route of port 1, slot 0. The target never forwards traffic externally.
Writes are disabled until explicitly enabled before startup. Network writes and
the UI use the same memory; Step/Run controls modeled scan execution.

## Identity profiles

- `research` is the default: an experimental LogixLab identity using vendor
  value `0xFFFF`.
- `logix-v35-l85e` is an optional compatibility profile for a matching `1756-L85E`
  v35 source. It advertises vendor 1, device type 14, product code 168 and the
  loaded source's minor revision.

Both profiles use a research serial. A compatible identity response does not
establish an authentic Rockwell target or native controller equivalence.
Incompatible project imports are rejected while the compatibility profile is
active. Compatible replacements update identity data and invalidate old sessions.

## Supported services

| Surface | Implemented subset |
| --- | --- |
| Encapsulation | ListIdentity, ListServices, ListInterfaces, Register/Unregister Session |
| Explicit transport | SendRRData, slot-0 Unconnected Send, Class 3 SendUnitData |
| Connections | Standard/Large Forward Open and Forward Close; sequence/replay checks |
| Objects | Identity attributes, Message Router class inventory and controller name |
| Symbol metadata | Paginated `0x55`; single/list attribute reads for 1, 2, 8 and 10 |
| Atomic access | BOOL and supported signed/unsigned integers and REAL; arrays and atomic members |
| Transfers | `0x4C` read, `0x4D` write, `0x52` fragmented read, `0x53` fragmented write |
| Integer masks | `0x4E` Read Modify Write, applying OR then AND masks |
| Multiple service | Bounded Multiple Service Packets with independent child operations |

Symbol attributes provide name, type, dimensions and effective external access.
Constants, aliases and member restrictions are honored. Private tags, AOI locals
and Safety program tags are not exposed. Firmware-internal attributes 3, 5 and 6
remain unsupported, so full native tag-upload initialization is still pending.

Supported atomic wire types are BOOL, SINT, INT, DINT, LINT, USINT, UINT, UDINT,
ULINT and REAL. Whole structures/STRING transfers, template/UDT layout services,
packed BOOL arrays and fragmented aggregate writes remain unsupported. Atomic
STRING members can be addressed individually.

## Write semantics

Each write request validates its payload and rolls back that request on failure.
Accepted fragments take effect immediately; a later failed fragment does not
undo prior fragments. Scans may run between separate requests. Fragments can
split an atomic element, but untouched bytes must already be known.

Integer masks may cover 1, 2, 4 or 8 low bytes of a sufficiently wide integer.
Upper bytes are preserved; OR is applied before AND. BOOL, REAL and aggregate
mask writes are unsupported.

Multiple Service Packet children are independent operations. Later child failure
does not roll back earlier writes, and an oversized combined response can fail
after earlier children executed.

## Bounds and traces

The target permits up to 16 TCP clients and 8 Class 3 connections per session.
Request payloads are bounded to 32 KiB. CIP replies are bounded to 480 bytes and
the negotiated connection size. Nested messages and dispatch work are bounded.
Reset, scope changes and project replacement require clients to reconnect.

The trace retains up to 1,000 events with peer/session, path, service, status,
error and bounded request/reply hex samples. Samples have a truncation flag.
Trace exports may contain project tag names and data; keep them in `.local/`.

## Native SDK diagnostic

`source/research/NativeStudioProbe` uses the optional official Logix Designer SDK
client to open a private ACD copy and attempt a mode query or GoOnline. The target
must be configured and visible in FactoryTalk Linx. The diagnostic accepts only
loopback slot-0 paths and never downloads, saves, changes mode or writes tags.

From the repository root, with native tooling available and the local endpoint
running:

```powershell
dotnet run --project source/research/NativeStudioProbe -- --acd .local/projects/demo.ACD --comm-path 'Ethernet\127.0.0.1\Backplane\0' --operation mode --out .local/probes/mode.json
```

Use `--operation go-online` for the broader connection attempt. Retain receipts
and before/after protocol traces locally. A native failure before any endpoint
traffic does not identify the next missing CIP service. A successful identity
query is still distinct from successful project correlation or online monitoring.
